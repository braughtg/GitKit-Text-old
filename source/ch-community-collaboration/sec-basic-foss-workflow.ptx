  <title>Basic FOSS Workflow</title>

  <p>
    Now that you have found an issue to work on, you will need to colloaborate with the project community to fix that issue. Collaboration in FOSS communities follows patterns of behavior known as <term>workflows</term>. <xref ref="ch-cc_sec-bfw_fig-basic-foss-workflow" /> shows a basic version of a FOSS workflow that is used by contributors working on FOSS projects.

        <description>The main project repo is forked into your GitHub space to create your remote copy.  Your remote copy is then cloned into your local development environment to create your local copy. Changes to your local copy are pushed to your remote copy and a pull request is made to the main project.

          <xref ref="ch-cc_sec-bfw_fig-basic-foss-workflow" /> illustrates a basic workflow that is used in many FOSS projects.  This workflow has the following 5 steps: <term>Fork</term>, <term>Clone</term>, <term>Edit</term>, <term>Push</term>, and <term>Pull Request</term>. Match each term on the left with the appropraite description on the right.
